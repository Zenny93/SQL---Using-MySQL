# SQL---Using-MySQL
This repository contains how I utilized MySQL to create a database for the chelsea soccer team which contains tables with different parameters such as name of players, their injury status, the amount of games won and so on. The tables are also linked together using Primary keys(PKs) and Foreign Keys(FKs). In addition, the repository also contains activities involving the use of several SQL queries  such as Group By, Joins and so onto extract data from a database. I also connected to the database created using php , and used the php query to do some analyses.
